This approach, inspired by [**OpenAI o1-o3 models**](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/), demonstrates that **longer reasoning time** during inference can enhance model performance.\n",

Recent research from [DeepMind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314) suggests that **test-time compute** can be scaled optimally through strategies like iterative self-refinement or using a reward model.\n",
